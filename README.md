RealTime
=============

RealTime is a plugin that changes the time to reflect the servers time (at least the hours).  
For example:  
If the real time is 16.40 then the minecraft time would be 16.00

I haven't done a relly thorough testing, but it seems to work.

------------
It should not work with plugins that changes the time.  
As for other plugins that deals with time, I have no idea  
if they would would work or not.
